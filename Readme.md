### How to run using built image
1. Create a folder where you'd like to run the docker image
2. Create a folder called `config` or similiar to keep your configuration in
3. Make a copy of `config.example.toml` called `config.toml` and place it in your `config` folder
4. Edit the config file
5. Run the following command `docker run -d --name reddit-radio -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config codecatt/reddit-radio:latest`

### Running using Docker from the repo
1. Clone this repo
    `git clone https://github.com/codecat/reddit-radio.git`
2. Build the Docker image
    `docker build . -t reddit-radio`
3. Create a folder called `config` or similiar to keep your configuration in
4. Make a copy of `config.example.toml` called `config.toml` and place it in your `config` folder
