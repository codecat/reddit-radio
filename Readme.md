# Reddit Radio
A general purpose Discord bot made for the [/r/hardstyle Discord](https://discord.gg/hardstyle).

## Features
It does:

* Live radio re-streaming to voice channels (using multiple bot users), automatically turned on/off when someone joins/leaves the bound channel.
* Jukebox YouTube streams and play them in a voice channel.
* Makes Headhunterz shrug. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Requirements

* Git installed and callable in the terminal via "git"
